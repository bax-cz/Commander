BUGS:
- when using quickfind, the drag & drop to external app/window does not work (WM_LBUTTONUP gets eaten) also double click does not work
- list-view occasionally stays in quickfind mode
- selections (marked items) are lost when panel reloads data
- the focus rect is drawn for a short period at 0 index when changing directories
- the list-view in panel-tab occasionally loses focus and produces blank window
- DjVu viewer rarely crashes on Vista 32-bit (setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C") race condition??)
- keyboard shortcuts (tab, esc,..) don't work when there is a modal dialog opened within modeless dialog (eg. MessageBox in fileviewer) - message pump per dialog is needed
- rename files on disk sometimes doesn't work - probably filesystemwatcher fault ??
- ftp client won't start copying files from server - probably connection limit ?? (happened on ftp.adobe.com)
- ftp client ends up in an infinite loop when firewall blocks non-passive connection
- ftp client's blocking socket randomly timeouts on 'select' function (ftp4.webzdarma.cz)

- bugged 32-bit zlib's inffas32.asm code - FIXED (changes taken from https://github.com/madler/zlib/pull/369/files)
- finding case-insensitive text in binary files fails - FIXED
- SHA-512 checksums wrong results on files greater than 536 870 911 (0x1FFFFFFF) bytes - FIXED (version from GNU/CoreUtils)
- uniso crashes in uniso.cpp, line: 884 on FreeImage(IsoImage* image) - FIXED
